This receiver fetches stats from a RabbitMQ node using the [RabbitMQ Management Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).

> :construction: This receiver is in **BETA**. Configuration fields and metric data model are subject to change.
## Prerequisites

This receiver supports RabbitMQ versions `3.8` and `3.9`.

The RabbitMQ Management Plugin must be enabled by following the [official instructions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#getting-started).

Also, a user with at least [monitoring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#permissions) level permissions must be used for monitoring.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:
- `username`
- `password`

The following settings are optional:

- `endpoint` (default: `http://localhost:15672`): The URL of the node to be monitored.
- `collection_interval` (default = `10s`): This receiver collects metrics on an interval. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
- `tls` (defaults defined [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)): TLS control. By default insecure settings are rejected and certificate verification is on.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  rabbitmq:
    endpoint: http://localhost:15672
    username: otelu
    password: $RABBITMQ_PASSWORD
    collection_interval: 10s
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml). TLS config is documented further under the [opentelemetry collector's configtls package](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml)
