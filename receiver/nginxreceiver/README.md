This receiver can fetch stats from a Nginx instance using a mod_status endpoint.

## Details

## Configuration

### Nginx Module
You must configure NGINX to expose status information by editing the NGINX
configuration.  Please see
[ngx_http_stub_status_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html)
for a guide to configuring the NGINX stats module `ngx_http_stub_status_module`.

### Receiver Config

> :information_source: This receiver is in beta and configuration fields are subject to change.

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (default: `http://localhost:80/status`): The URL of the nginx status endpoint

The following settings are optional:

- `collection_interval` (default = `10s`): This receiver runs on an interval.
Each time it runs, it queries nginx, creates metrics, and sends them to the
next consumer. The `collection_interval` configuration option tells this
receiver the duration between runs. This value must be a string readable by
Golang's `ParseDuration` function (example: `1h30m`). Valid time units are
`ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  nginx:
    endpoint: "http://localhost:80/status"
    collection_interval: 10s
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go)
with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).
