# DataPoint Context

The DataPoint Context is a Context implementation for [pdata DataPoints](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/pdata/pmetric), the collector's internal representation for OTLP metric data points.  This Context should be used when interacting with individual OTLP data points.

## Paths
In general, the DataPoint Context supports accessing pdata using the field names from the [metrics proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto).  All integers are returned and set via `int64`.  All doubles are returned and set via `float64`.

The following fields are the exception.

## Enums

The DataPoint Context supports the enum names from the [metrics proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto). 

In addition, it also supports an enum for metrics data type, with the numeric value being [defined by pdata](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/pdata/pmetric/metrics.go).

| Enum Symbol                            | Value |
|----------------------------------------|-------|
| METRIC_DATA_TYPE_NONE                  | 0     |
| METRIC_DATA_TYPE_GAUGE                 | 1     |
| METRIC_DATA_TYPE_SUM                   | 2     |
| METRIC_DATA_TYPE_HISTOGRAM             | 3     |
| METRIC_DATA_TYPE_EXPONENTIAL_HISTOGRAM | 4     |
| METRIC_DATA_TYPE_SUMMARY               | 5     |
